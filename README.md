# Profit-Making-Sentimental-Analysis
This sentimental analysis solution for an online shopping site will analyze the review of the product.


My approach to this problem is very simple. We have to find
whether a product review is good or bad. If it is good then we
don’t need to do anything. but if it is a bad one then strictly, we
have to remove that particular product from the site. So, if bad
review products are not there in the site, then the entire site
looks perfect. But it is not possible to manually check reviews for
each products. 
Because there are more than billion products are there in
online shopping site. So, by using man power it is not possible to
analyze the review. So that I have made a system which
automatically predicts the customers review.
To achieve my solution, I have used the technique called
“Sentimental Analysis”
As per the definition: Sentiment analysis is a common task in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it perform the text
classification where an AI model gets trained to identify the
emotional of a text as positive, negative or neutral.
in other words, sentimental analysis is the process of finding the
emotions of the given text.
For example, “I love TCS” …. This statement is a positive
one. In the same way, if any customer write review online, then it
will be categorized as either positive or negative(We are not
focusing on neutral here ). If any company is able to respond
quickly to the customers feedbacks, then they can maintain a
positive customer experience.
Machine learning and AI are the main block of the sentimental
analysis. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that
allows software applications to become more accurate at
predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do
so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to
predict new output values.
Using Machine Learning Approach, we can apply many famous
ML algorithms. Using the ML algorithm, we make our own
Machine Learning Model to predict whether a customer review is
positive or negative.
